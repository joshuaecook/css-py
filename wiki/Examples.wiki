The code examples below assume this snippet as a prefix:

{{{
from css.parse import parse
data = """
    em {
    padding: 2px; 
    margin: 1em;
    border-width: medium;
    border-style: dashed;
    line-height: 2.4em;
    }
    p { color: red; font-size: 12pt }
    p:first-letter { color: green; font-size: 200% }
    p:first-line { color: blue }"""
}}}

=== Iterating an entire stylesheet. ===

A `Stylesheet` instance can be iterated to yield each rule, including `@charset` and `@import` rules, in the order they originally appear.

{{{
for rule in parse(data):
    print rule
    # or do something with each rule
}}}

=== Iterating the declarations of a single rule. ===

Rules that contain other rules, such as a `Media` or `Page` instances yield their child rules. A `Ruleset` instance yields its declarations.

{{{
for decl in parse(data)[0]:
    print decl
    # or do something else with each declaration
}}}
